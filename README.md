ProgLang
========
This repo stores all the source code for my various assignments and experiments I am writing for a class I'm taking through Coursera.

## Organization
Code is separated into the relevant section of the course which it was written for. Homework code is indicated by its filename (ex. `hw1.sml`) and accompanying tests are denoted by their filename ending in `test.sml`.

## About the class
The course in question is [*Programming Languages*](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang), offered by the University of Washington through Coursera. The session I am participating in runs from 2014-10-02 through 2014-12-11.
